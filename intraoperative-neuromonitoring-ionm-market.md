<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intraoperative Neuromonitoring (IONM) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Insource IONM</li><li>Outsource IONM</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Insource IONM refers to a system where hospitals have their own in-house team of neuromonitoring technicians and equipment, allowing for real-time monitoring during surgeries. Outsource IONM, on the other hand, involves hiring a third-party neuromonitoring company to provide monitoring services during surgeries. Both types of IONM aim to protect the nervous system during high-risk surgeries, but the key difference lies in whether the hospital manages the equipment and staff internally or outsources the service to an external provider.</p></p>
