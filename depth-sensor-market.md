<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Depth Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Sensing</li><li>Passive Sensing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Depth Sensor market consists of two main types: Active Sensing and Passive Sensing. Active sensing involves emitting an energy source, such as infrared light, and measuring the time it takes for the signal to bounce back from an object to determine its distance. Passive sensing, on the other hand, relies on ambient light or other environmental factors to detect objects without emitting a signal. Both types of sensors have their own advantages and applications in various industries such as robotics, automotive, and consumer electronics.</p></p>
