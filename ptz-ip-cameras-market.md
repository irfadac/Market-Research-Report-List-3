<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PTZ IP Cameras Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centralized IP Cameras</li><li>DeCentralized IP Cameras</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Centralized IP cameras are traditional surveillance cameras that require a central network video recorder (NVR) to store and manage the footage. These cameras are controlled remotely and have limited flexibility in terms of monitoring angles. On the other hand, Decentralized IP cameras have built-in storage capabilities and can operate independently without the need for an NVR. They offer more flexibility in monitoring angles and are easier to install and maintain. Decentralized cameras are typically more cost-effective for smaller surveillance systems.</p></p>
