<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Desensitizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fluoride-containing Dental Desensitizer</li><li>Fluoride-free dental desensitizer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dental desensitizers are divided into two main types: fluoride-containing and fluoride-free. Fluoride-containing dental desensitizers work by strengthening the enamel and reducing sensitivity. They contain fluoride, which helps protect teeth from decay and sensitivity. On the other hand, fluoride-free dental desensitizers do not contain fluoride but instead use other ingredients like potassium nitrate or calcium phosphate to desensitize teeth. Both types of dental desensitizers are effective in reducing tooth sensitivity and providing relief to patients.</p></p>
