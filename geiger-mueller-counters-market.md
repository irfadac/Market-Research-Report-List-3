<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geiger-Mueller Counters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>End Window Type</li><li>Windowless Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Geiger-Mueller Counters are commonly divided into two market types based on the design of the detection window: End Window Type and Windowless Type. End Window Type counters have a thin mica or glass window at one end, allowing for the detection of low-energy radiation. Windowless Type counters, on the other hand, do not have a window and are better suited for detecting higher-energy radiation. Both types are widely used in various industries such as nuclear medicine, nuclear power plants, and environmental monitoring.</p></p>
