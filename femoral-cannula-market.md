<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Femoral Cannula Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unipolar</li><li>Bipolar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Femoral cannulas are commonly used in cardiac surgeries for providing access to the femoral artery. There are two types of femoral cannulas: unipolar and bipolar. Unipolar cannulas have a single tip for delivering blood to the heart-lung machine, while bipolar cannulas have two tips for both blood delivery and drainage. The market for femoral cannulas is divided based on these types, with unipolar cannulas being more commonly used in some procedures, while bipolar cannulas offer the advantage of improved drainage and reduced risk of air embolism.</p></p>
