<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Fibers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multi-Mode Fiber Optics</li><li>Single-Mode Fiber Optics</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Optical fibers are categorized into two main types: Multi-Mode Fiber Optics and Single-Mode Fiber Optics. Multi-Mode fibers have larger cores, allowing multiple modes of light to travel through them. They are commonly used for shorter distance applications such as local area networks. Single-Mode fibers have smaller cores, which enable only a single mode of light to travel through them. These fibers are ideal for long-distance communication applications like telecommunications and data transmission. Both types play a crucial role in the expanding optical fibers market.</p></p>
