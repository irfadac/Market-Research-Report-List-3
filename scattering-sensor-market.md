<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Scattering Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Surface Mounted</li><li>Portable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surface mounted scattering sensors are devices that are installed directly onto a surface, such as a wall or ceiling, for continuous monitoring of a particular area. This type of sensor is ideal for applications where a permanent installation is needed. Portable scattering sensors, on the other hand, are designed for temporary use and can be easily moved from one location to another. They are commonly used for on-the-go monitoring or for testing different areas within a short period of time. Both types of sensors serve different purposes but contribute to improving overall safety and security.</p></p>
