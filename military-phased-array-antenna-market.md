<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Military Phased Array Antenna Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>AESA</li><li>PESA</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Military phased array antennas are advanced radar systems used for surveillance, threat detection, and communication in the defense sector. There are two main types of phased array antennas - Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) and Passive Electronically Scanned Array (PESA). AESA antennas use multiple transmit/receive modules to steer and scan the radar beam electronically, offering faster and more precise performance. On the other hand, PESA antennas use a single transmitter and multiple receivers to scan the radar beam mechanically. Both types are crucial for modern military operations, offering enhanced capabilities in detecting and tracking threats.</p></p>
