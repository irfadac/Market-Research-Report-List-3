<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The RFID System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive RFID</li><li>Active RFID</li></ul></p>
<p><p>RFID systems are divided into two main market types: Passive RFID and Active RFID. Passive RFID systems rely on powered readers to send signals to tags, which then reflect the signals back with information stored in them. These systems are cost-effective and used for short-range applications. On the other hand, Active RFID systems have tags with their power source and are capable of transmitting signals over longer distances. These systems are suitable for tracking high-value assets or people in real-time.</p></p>
