<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peptide APIs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Phase Peptide Synthesis (LPPS)</li><li>Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Peptide APIs are important components in drug development, and there are two main methods of producing them: Liquid Phase Peptide Synthesis (LPPS) and Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS). LPPS involves synthesizing peptides in solution, allowing for greater flexibility in sequence variation. On the other hand, SPPS involves synthesizing peptides on a solid support, enabling easier purification and higher yields. Both methods have their advantages and are utilized in the pharmaceutical industry for the production of peptide APIs.</p></p>
