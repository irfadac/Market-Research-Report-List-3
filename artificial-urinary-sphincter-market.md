<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Urinary Sphincter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Artificial Urinary Sphincter with Balloon Reservoir</li><li>Artificial Urinary Sphincter with Spring</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Artificial Urinary Sphincter with Balloon Reservoir is a type of device used to treat urinary incontinence by mimicking the natural sphincter muscle. It consists of a balloon reservoir that is filled with fluid to create pressure around the urethra, preventing urine leakage. On the other hand, Artificial Urinary Sphincter with Spring works similarly to the balloon reservoir type but uses a spring mechanism instead of a balloon to create pressure. Both types are effective in treating urinary incontinence and improving bladder control.</p></p>
